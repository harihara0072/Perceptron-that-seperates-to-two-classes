# Perceptron-that-seperates-to-two-classes

This is a practice with a single neuron decision boundary and learning rule. It will display the decision boundary for a single neuron with two inputs(Green color region and Red color region)

 
The program also includes

Slider 1: Which is used to change the weight 1 between -10 and 10. Default value = 1

Slider 2: Which is used to change the weight 2 between -10 and 10. Default value = 1

Slider 3: Which is used to change the bias between -10 and 10. Default value=0

Button1: Which is used to train the percepton. Clicking this button should adjust the weights and bias for 100 steps using the learning rule. Wnew =Wold+ epT  where  e = t â€“ a

Button 2: Which is used to generate random data. Assuming that there are only two possible target values 1 and -1 (two classes), this button should create 4 random data points (two points for each class). The range of data points should be from -10 to 10 for both dimensions.
 
Drop Down Menu:
The drop down box should allow the user to select between three transfer functions (Symmetrical Hard limit, Hyperbolic Tangent, and Linear)
